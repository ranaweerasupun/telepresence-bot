Below is the fastest path to test Prototype 1 with two real computers on 
two different networks:

Role		Computer		Browser page you‚Äôll open
Operator	Your Mac		https://YOUR-PROJECT.glitch.me/ (the original UI)
Robot		Your Windows PC		https://YOUR-PROJECT.glitch.me/robot.html (a tiny page we add)

The only code you need to add is that robot.html file (2 minutes). Everything 
else you already built stays the same.


Step 0‚ÄÉDeploy your server to Glitch

	Push the folder (without node_modules) to GitHub or zip-upload to Glitch.

	Glitch installs and starts; note the live URL, e.g.
		https://telepresence-proto1.glitch.me

You can still dev-test locally, but both computers must be able to reach the same 
signalling host, so Glitch is easier.


Step 1‚ÄÉAdd public/robot.html

Create public/robot.html next to index.html:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Robot Peer (demo)</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Robot Peer</h2>
  <video id="local" autoplay muted playsinline width="320"></video>

  <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
  <script>
    // 1Ô∏è‚É£  Ask user for Robot ID once page loads
    const robotId = prompt("Enter Robot ID to host:", "TESTBOT")?.trim();
    if (!robotId) location.reload();

    // 2Ô∏è‚É£  Connect to signalling
    const sock = io({ transports:["websocket"] });    // guarantee WS (Glitch likes that)

    // 3Ô∏è‚É£  WebRTC setup
    const pc = new RTCPeerConnection({
      iceServers:[{urls:"stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"}]
    });
    pc.onicecandidate = e => e.candidate && sock.emit('candidate', e.candidate);

    // 4Ô∏è‚É£  Get cam+mic
    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video:true, audio:true})
      .then(stream=>{
        document.getElementById("local").srcObject = stream;
        stream.getTracks().forEach(t=> pc.addTrack(t, stream));
      });

    // 5Ô∏è‚É£  Signalling handlers
    sock.on('offer', async off=>{
      await pc.setRemoteDescription(off);
      await pc.setLocalDescription(await pc.createAnswer());
      sock.emit('answer', pc.localDescription);
    });
    sock.on('candidate', c=> pc.addIceCandidate(c));

    // 6Ô∏è‚É£  Join room
    sock.emit('join', { robotId, role:'robot' });
    console.log("Robot ready in room", robotId);
  </script>
</body>
</html>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why? This page contains the same ‚Äústub‚Äù logic you pasted in DevTools, but now it‚Äôs a 
real file‚Äîso no duplicate operator code runs and no ‚Äúpc already declared‚Äù errors.

Step 2‚ÄÉReconnect both peers
	A. Operator (Mac)

		Open https://telepresence-proto1.glitch.me.

		Type exactly the same Robot ID (e.g. TESTBOT).

		Click Connect and allow camera/mic.

	B. Robot (Windows)

		Open https://telepresence-proto1.glitch.me/robot.html.

		Enter the identical Robot ID in the prompt.

		Allow camera/mic.

Step 3‚ÄÉWatch it work

	The Mac tab will show Local Preview (your mac-cam) and, after a second or two, Robot 
	Feed (Windows webcam).

	Audio will flow both ways.

	Chrome dev console on each side will log ICE candidates and ‚ÄúRemote track added‚Äù.

Troubleshooting checklist
Problem						Fix
üîí Browser blocks camera/mic			Ensure page is HTTPS (Glitch already is). Accept the permission prompt.
üîÑ Stuck on ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù				Open DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí WebSocket. If WS closes, check Glitch logs (needs active User-Agent only for non-browser code).
üîá Video shows but no audio (or vice-versa)	Confirm both getUserMedia calls include audio:true.
üåê ICE fails across some networks		STUN alone can fail ~20 % of the time. Add a TURN server to iceServers later if needed.


How the connection happens (recap)

	Both peers join the same Socket.io room (robotId).

	Server detects robot + operator ‚áí emits ready to operator.

	Operator creates SDP offer ‚Üí sends via WS.

	Robot sets offer, creates answer ‚Üí sends back.

	Both sides exchange ICE candidates (public + local addresses).

	First candidate pair that can talk does a DTLS handshake ‚Üí encrypted SRTP media flows directly between the two computers‚Äîno video passes through Glitch.

	The console dump you saw earlier was just Chrome printing the Socket object; the TypeError was because operator code ran in a tab we pretended was a robot. Moving robot logic into robot.html removes that conflict.

	You now have end-to-end, cross-network WebRTC with custom signalling. The next step (when you‚Äôre ready) is to replace robot.html with the real Python + GStreamer client on the Raspberry Pi.
